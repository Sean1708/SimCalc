When implementing exit command, might need to use an extern int as test variable
for the while loop and set it to false on exit command.

For functions maybe a structure which contains name, no. args and args list.

There are conflicts at the moment, I'm not good enough at formal grammar to know
how to reduce them.

Write a decent fucking Makefile.

merge uservar and loadlib into one, maybe called table

write the dylib of wrappers around math.h functions

write a source file logging.[ch] which has yyerror and friends in
