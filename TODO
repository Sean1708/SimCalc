Generalise functions to be able to take multiple arguments.

There are conflicts at the moment, I'm not good enough at formal grammar to know
how to reduce them.

Write a decent fucking Makefile.

merge uservar and loadlib into one, maybe called table

redo library loading, maybe use macros to create the function, also work in
variables

write a source file logging.[ch] which has yyerror and friends in
