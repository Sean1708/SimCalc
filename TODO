When implementing exit command, might need to use an extern int as test variable
for the while loop and set it to false on exit command.

For functions maybe a structure which contains name, no. args and args list.

There are conflicts at the moment, I'm not good enough at formal grammar to know
how to reduce them.

Write a decent fucking Makefile.

in lex first search for already made variable, then make a new entry either way
return ptr, set in bison
