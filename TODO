When implementing exit command, might need to use an extern int as test variable
for the while loop and set it to false on exit command.

For functions maybe a structure which contains name, no. args and args list.

Implement abdolute as |x| possibly, though this may be ambiguous.

There are conflicts at the moment, I'm not good enough at formal grammar to know
how to reduce them.
